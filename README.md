## Music genre and composer classification using deep learning

The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of the composition prediction model by experimenting with different architectures and techniques. Additionally, exploring various preprocessing steps, such as data normalization and augmentation, could enhance the performance of the models. Created four model versions: LSTM 1 layer, LSTM 3 layer (2 ver.) 3. CNN numerical data; 4. CNN image data
